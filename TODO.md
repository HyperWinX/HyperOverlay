# ToDo

Below are notes I have planned/may consider to do as well with their status. Things that have been checked will be added to the overlay public when it is tested for potetial problems on my end. Once public they will  be removed from this file.


### High

- [ ] Fix any broken 9999 ebuilds, all need a quick pass for changes in useflags and deps


### Medium

- [ ] Update gentoo wiki Budgie section with instructions and introductions.


### Low

- none


### Unlikely

- [ ] Make a separate document for further tweaks of budgie-desktop if wanted. (e.g. not showing nm-applet tray icon if using the network applet from budgie-extras)
- [ ] Look into specific budgie themes maybe.
